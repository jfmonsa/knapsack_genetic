# Intro

Solving the knapsack problem by genetic algorithm aproach. comparing dynamic programming aproach.

## Knapsack problem statement
> Given a set of objects which have both a value and a weight $(v_i , w_i)$ what is the maximum value we can obtain by selecting a subset of these objects such that the sum of the weights does not exceed the knapsack capacity?

Goals:
+ Fill the knapsack without exceeding the capacity
+ maximize the value
